There are other projects that display the applications of my skills (my ability to deploy Python, C++, SQL, and other skills into work) however, due to the Honor Code at the University of Michigan, public posting of such code would be in direct violation of such Honor Code, if you have questions about what these projects are, ask! 

Thank you for reading!
